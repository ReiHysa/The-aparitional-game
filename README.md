The aparitional game -> A game with multiple different endings!!

This is a game created through self study before I started the General Assembly course. This was a hard self prokect to start off with 
as it involved things that I had not learnt yet at that moment of time. This forced me to learn new skills which allowed me to learn 
new techniques and skills which were later used during my course in GA.

The aparitional game forced me to be more creative and create a story with multiple different scenarios and endings. The overall code
started off difficult but as the first few codes began to work I was able to reuse the previous codes to develop the story.

This was a good starting project as it allowed me to sharpen my thoughts and work on javascript without having to focus too much on 
CSS.
